The monte carlo AI agent works by simulating large numbers of games and deciding the best moves to take based on the results of those simulations. 
More specifically, at any given point in the game, the agent loops through all legal moves (up to 7) and simulates n (50 in my implementation) games from that point on. For instance, if the agent considers the move dropping a chip in the zeroth column, it will copy the board, make the move and then continue playing the game by having each player randomly drop a chip until either someone wins or the board fills and there's a tie. It does this for each potential move (in this case column=0) 50 times and tallies the number of wins that arose from simulating a game beginning with that move. After looping through all legal moves at a position and simulating the required number of games, it selects the move that gave the most number of wins from the simulations. Let's say column=0 gave 28 wins and column=4 gave the most wins at 37, it would select the move column=4 as the move to make. The second (random) agent then moves and the process continues, until the game ends.
